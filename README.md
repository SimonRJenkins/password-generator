The Password Generator solo project from the Javascript Challenges section of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. 

This involved being given a Figma design to implement and then also adding the functionality myself.

It generates two passwords that are 15 characters in length and contain a mixture of letters, numbers, and symbols from the printable ASCII character set.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
