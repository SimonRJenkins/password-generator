The Password Generator solo project from the Javascript Challenges section of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. 

This involved being given a Figma design to implement and then also adding the functionality myself.

The user can choose if the passwords contain just letters or include numbers and/or symbols. The length can also be selected with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 15 characters.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
